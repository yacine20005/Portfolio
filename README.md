## 📁 Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure:

```
/
├── app/                # Main application folder (pages, layout)
├── components/         # Reusable components
│   ├── sections/       # Page sections (Hero, About, etc.)
│   └── ui/             # Shadcn/UI components
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── lib/                # Utility functions, type definitions, and data
│   ├── data.ts         # Centralized portfolio content
│   └── utils.ts        # Helper functions
├── public/             # Static assets (images, documents)
└── styles/             # Global styles
```

## ✏️ Customization

To make this portfolio your own, you'll primarily need to modify the content file:

-   **`lib/data.ts`**: This file exports objects and arrays containing all the text for the site, including your name, bio, links, skills, projects, and work experience. Simply change the values in this file to update the entire site.
-   **`public/`**: Replace the placeholder images and documents (`CV.pdf`) with your own.
-   **`app/globals.css`**: You can tweak the base styling and color variables here to change the overall look and feel.
